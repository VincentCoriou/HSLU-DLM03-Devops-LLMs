    "# Week 03 - AutoFix\n",
    "\n",
    "This week, you will delve into the practical application of large language models (LLMs) to automate **code remediation**, a key challenge in modern DevOps. You will implement an “AutoFix” system that automatically proposes fixes for issues identified by a language server.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal: Automated Issue Resolution\n",
    "Your primary task is to implement an `auto_fix` function that serves as the core of this system. This function will act as a bridge between **diagnostic output** and **code changes**, using an LLM to generate a precise solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Input**: An error object returned by the language server (e.g. a type-checking failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output**: A proposed change in unified diff format to resolve the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on designing an effective LLM prompt and context strategy that reliably converts a structured error message into a correct and syntactically valid unified diff."
